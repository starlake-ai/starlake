# Transform

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';


Building a datawarehouse, involves chaining complex transformations and aggregations using SQL queries.
That's all Starlake Transform feature is about. It allows you to create a new table from an existing ones, using a SQL query and describe how this table should be stored.
Starlake Transform handles transparently:
- the creation of the new table,
- the execution of the query and all the underlying queries, including dependent transforms (DAG of transforms)
- the storage of the result
- the generation of the merge statement when needed
- infer the documentation of the attributes of the target table

using extra YAML syntax, you can also:
- define a partitioning and clustering strategy for the target table
- define primary and foreign keys for the target table
- define a data retention policy for the target table
- define a data quality policy for the target table
- document any attribute of the target table
- apply security rules to the data source that will translate to row level and column security instructions in the target database
- store data using multiple strategies (append, upsert / merge, delete, truncate ...)
- run any python code and store its result in the target table
- schedule the execution of the transform using a cron expression


Starlake has been tested with BigQuery, Databricks, Snowflake and Postgres. It should work with any database that supports SQL.
