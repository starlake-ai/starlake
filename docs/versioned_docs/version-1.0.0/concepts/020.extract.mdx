## Extraction strategies

When extracting data, many options are available. In this section we detail why Starlake has chosen a strategy over the others
and how it better fit use cases.

- Remote extraction: In this mode, the client access remotely the database and extract the data through a JDBC connection.
- Local extraction (used in starlake): In this mode, the client access locally the database and extract the data through a local connection and then copy extracted data
using command line tools to the remote datawarehouse for loading
- Change Data capture: Data is incrementally pushed to the outside world for further processing.

The table below present the pros and cons of each mode


| Criteria             | Local Access (Starlake)   | Remote Access            | Change Data Capture   |
|----------------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Support large volumes of data | __Yes. Also note that starlake can take advantage of all the processing power to parallelize the extraction process__ | No or extremely slow, since the data is pulled one record at a the over the network| __Yes. data is extracted in near realtime__ |
| Network Security | __Yes. Happen close to the source database__ | No. At least one port need to be open for incoming requests over the internet | __Yes. Data is pushed from the local network__ |
| Very simple infrastructure | __Yes. Simple command to extract the data__ | __Yes. Simple command to extract the data__ | No. Requires a middleware infrastructure, aka Kafka, Kafka connect ...|
| Easy load to the Datwarehouse | __Yes. Exported data are loaded as files in bulk mode into the datawarehouse__ | No. Data is loaded one record at a time | No. Data need to be reconstructed before being available for use|
| Instant availability| No. Require extraction job to be scheduled | No. Require extraction job to be scheduled | __Yes if data is reconstructed in realtime__ |
| Summary | Fast and easy to setup. Need to be scheduled | Require extra network configuration, slow and need to be scheduled | Data available in realtime but complex to setup |

## Extraction modes

### Full extraction

The full extraction strategy is the simplest one. It consists in extracting all the data from the source system and loading it
into the dataware. This strategy is the easiest to implement as it does not require any specific feature from the source system.
However, it is also the most inefficient one as it extracts all the data, even the one that has not changed since the last extraction.



### Incremental extraction

The incremental extraction strategy is the most common one. It consists in extracting only the data that has changed since the last extraction.
This strategy is the most efficient one as it only extracts a small amount of data. However, it requires the source system to provide a way to
identify the data that has changed since the last extraction. This is usually done by using a timestamp or a sequence number.
