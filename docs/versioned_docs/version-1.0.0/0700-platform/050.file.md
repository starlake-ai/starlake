# Local filesystem


## Sample setup
If running the samples on MacOS or Linux, you may skip this section.

To run the samples locally on Windows, you must first create the docker image :

````shell
$ docker build --build-arg SL_VERSION=0.7.2.2 -t starlake .
````

One the docker image is built locally, run it :

````shell
$ docker run -it starlake:latest bash
````

## Running the samples

Inside the docker container, make sure you are in the `samples/local` folder

The userguide-template is first duplicated into the samples/local folder to create a startup project  

````shell
$ ./0.data-init.sh
````
Then you need to import he files located in userguide/incoming into the correct pending folder depending on the domain they belong to:
````shell
$ ./1.data-import.sh
````
To start the ingestion process, run the load command. The resulting tables should be available in the userguide/datasets/accepted folder :
````shell
$ ./2.data-load.sh
````

To join multiple datasets using the KPI job example located in userguide/metadata/jobs/kpi.sql, run the corresponding transformation :
````shell
$ ./3.data-transform.sh
````


To view the data ingested and stored as parquet files :
````shell
$ ./4.data-view-results.sh
````
To exit the spark shell above type `:quit`

To view the log produced :
````shell
$ ./4.data-view-audit.sh
````
To exit the spark shell above type `:quit`


## Optional

You may view the relationship between your tables by generating a graphviz diagram using the command below:
````shell
$ ./1.data-visualization.sh
````
