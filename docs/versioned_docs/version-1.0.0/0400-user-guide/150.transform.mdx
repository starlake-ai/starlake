# Transform


import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';

Now that our file is successfully loaded and available as a table, we usually need to join them and expose KPIs.
This is where Starlake Transforms come into play.
Three types of jobs are supported:
- SQL jobs: a single SQL file
- Jinja2 jobs: a single SQL/Python/PySpark file with Jinja2 templating
- Python jobs: a single Python/PySpark file

## SQL Transforms
We create a file `metadata/transform/kpi/customers_kpi.sql` with the following content
```SQL
select count(*) cnt from sales.customers
```



This SQL file alone is sufficient to be a Starlake Transform. It instructs Starlake to put the result of the query in a schema (dataset in BigQuery)
named after the folder name,  `kpi` in our case and the table named after the sql filename aka `customers_kpi`.

That's it! We can now run the transform as follows:

```sh
$ cd $HOME/userguide
$ starlake transform --name kpi.customers_kpi

$ starlake.sh transform \
            --name db_schema.transform_name

```
The transform job will run against the connectionRef defined in the application.sl.yml file.
The result of the query will be stored in the table `kpi.customers_kpi` in the `datasets` folder.


:::note
By default, the existing table data is overriden. To append data, use the `write` option in the `metadata/transform/kpi/_config.sl.yml` file:
```yaml
transform:
  default:
    write: APPEND
```

This instructs to run all transformations in `kpi` folder in append mode.
To run only this transformation in append mode, update the __config_ file as follows:

```yaml {5-6}
transform:
  default:
    write: OVERWRITE
  tasks:
    - name: customers_kpi
      write: APPEND
```

:::

The transform job will run against the connectionRef defined in the application.sl.yml file.

## Jinja2 Transforms
Starlake Transforms support Jinja2 templating inside SQL requests.
To illustrate how this works, we will create two tables, one containing customers living in France
and another one containing customers living in the USA.

We create a file `metadata/transform/kpi/bycountry.sql` with the following content

```SQL
select * from sales.customers where lower(country) like lower('{{ p_country }}')
```

By creating the sql file in the kpi folder, we instruct Starlake to put the result of the query in a schema (dataset in BigQuery)
named 'kpi'.
But we need the french customers to be stored in the table `cust_france` and the american customers in the table `cust_usa`.

Since by default the table is named after the SQL file name, ```bycountry.sql``` will create a table named ```bycountry```.
We need to configure a dynamic table name based on the country name in the YAML configuration file.
Therefore, we need to update the YAML file `metadata/transform/kpi/_config.sl.yml`.
This file will instruct where the result of the SQL request will be stored.

```yaml {5-7}
transform:
  tasks:
    - name: customers_kpi
      write: APPEND
    - name: bycountry # We define the name of the transform.
      table: cust_{{ p_country }} # We define the table name based on the country name.
      write: OVERWRITE # We overwrite the table each time the job is executed.

```

<Tabs groupId="customers">
<TabItem value="usa" label="American customers table">

```sh
$ cd $HOME/userguide
$ starlake transform --name kpi.bycountry --options p_country=USA
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="france" label="French customers table">

```sh
$ cd $HOME/userguide
$ starlake transform --name kpi.bycountry --options p_country=France
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `--options` argument may hold a comma separated list of variables / values pairs  that will be used for substitution and thus allowing a query to be parameterized.


:::note
The `--options` parameter is optional. If not provided,
the transform will be executed with the default values defined in the `env.sl.yml` and if `env.{{SL_ENV}}.sl.yml` files if they can be found in the `metadata` folder.
:::

## Python/PySpark Transforms
You mays also use Python/PySpark to create your transforms. The output of the job must be a PySpark DataFrame registered as a temporary view named `SL_THIS`.
The dataframe will be saved in a table named after the filename following the same naming rules as the SQL transforms.
Below is an example:

```python title="metadata/transform/kpi/pi.py"
import sys
from random import random
from operator import add

from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# From Apache Spark example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # get Spark context
    spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()

    # run any python/pyspark transform below
    partitions = 2
    n = 100000 * partitions

    def f(_: int) -> float:
        x = random() * 2 - 1
        y = random() * 2 - 1
        return 1 if x ** 2 + y ** 2 <= 1 else 0
    count = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(range(1, n + 1), partitions).map(f).reduce(add)
    result = 4.0 * count / n

    # put the result in a spark dataframe
    df = spark.createDataFrame([[result]])
    # register the dataframe as a temporary view named SL_THIS
    df.registerTempTable("SL_THIS")
```




## Incremental updates

You may also be willing to upsert the data in a table during a transformation. 
This works the same way as for the load time upserts, but the `merge` attribute is added to the table in the transformation configuration file file.

Say we did not use the merge strategy at load time and that after appending the data to the `sales.customers` table,
we want to create a table `silver.customers_last_signup` containing the most recent data for each customer. 
We can do this using the `merge` attribute in the transformation configuration file.


<Tabs groupId="transform">

<TabItem value="sql" label="SQL">

```sql title="metadata/transform/silver/unique_customers.sql"

SELECT * FROM sales.customers

```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="unique" label="Configuration">

```yaml title="metadata/transform/silver/unique_customers.sl.yml"
transform:
  default:
    write: OVERWRITE
  tasks:
    - name: customers_last_signup
      write: APPEND
      merge:
        timestamp: signup
        key: [id]
```
</TabItem>

</Tabs>



## Targeting another datawarehouse
Set the `connectionRef` property to the right value in the `metadata/application.sl.yml` file as explained previously in the [load step section](load#targeting-another-datawarehouse) .
