# Transform

Once your data is ingested, you may start to expose insights by joining them and / or create meaningful aggregates.

In the example below, we join the `sellers` and `orders` tables to compute the total amount sold by each seller.

We want to do it on parquet files and on BigQuery. We need to create 2 env files, one per environment.

## Parquet Transform

Create the `env.FS.sl.yml` file in the `metadata` folder as follows:

```yaml
env:
  myConnectionRef: "LocalFileSystem"
```

Create in teh folder `metadata/transform/kpi/` the SQL file that describe the job and name it `sellers_kpi.sl.yml`:

```SQL
select seller_email, sum(amount) as sum from sellers, orders where sellers.id = orders.seller_id group by sellers.seller_email
```

Before executing the job, we set the `SL_ENV` variable to `FS` to make sure variables are instantiated correctly:

````shell
export SL_ENV=FS
$ starlake.sh transform --name kpi.sellers_kpi
````

## BigQuery Transform
To execute the same request on BigQuery,  create the `env.BQ.sl.yml` file in the `metadata` folder as follows:

```yaml
env:
  myConnectionRef: "bigquery"
```

Before executing the job, we set the `SL_ENV` variable to `BQ` to make sure variables are instantiated correctly:

````shell
export SL_ENV=BQ
$ starlake.sh transform --name kpi.sellers_kpi
````



## Transform lineage

To display the job linage, run the following command:


<Tabs groupId="platforms">
<TabItem value="linux_macos" label="Linux/MacOS">

```sh
$ cd $HOME/myproject
$ $HOME/starlake/starlake.sh jobs2gv
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```powershell
c:\users\me\starlake> %userprofile%\starlake\starlake.cmd jobs2gv
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">

```sh
$ docker run                                                        \
-e SL_ROOT=/app/myproject                                    \
-v $HOME/myproject:/app/myproject -it starlake jobs2gv
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will display the dot file. Copy paste de result to the following URL: https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/
