# Environment
## Env specific variables

Starlake allows you to use variables almost everywhere in the domain and job files.
For example, you may need to set the folder name to watch to a different value
in development and production environments. This is where variables may help. They are enclosed inside 
`${}` or `{{}}`

Assuming we have a `sales` domain as follows:
```yaml
name: "sales"
directory: "${root_path}/sales"
ack: "ack"
extensions:
  - "json"
  - "psv"
  - "csv"
  - "dsv"
```

We create a file `env.DEV.comet.yml` in the metadata folder 

```yaml
env:
  root_path: "/tmp/quickstart"
```

and the file `env.PROD.comet.yml` in the metadata folder

```yaml
env:
  root_path: "/cluster/quickstart"
```

To apply the substitution in the DEV env set the COMET_ENV variable before running Starlake as follows:

```shell
export COMET_ENV=DEV
```

In Production set it rather to:

```shell
export COMET_ENV=PROD
```

## Global Variables
To define variables across environment, simply declare them in the `env.comet.yml` file in the `metadata` folder.

Global variables definitions may be superseded by the env specific variables files.  


## Preset variables
The following variables are predefined and may be used anywhere:

| Date Time Variable | Format                                |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|
| comet_date         | yyyyMMdd                              |
| comet_datetime     | yyyyMMddHHmmss                        |
| comet_year         | yy                                    |
| comet_month        | MM                                    |
| comet_day          | dd                                    |
| comet_hour         | HH                                    |
| comet_minute       | mm                                    |
| comet_second       | ss                                    |
| comet_milli        | SSS                                   |
| comet_epoch_second | Number of seconds since 1/1/1970      |
| comet_epoch_milli  | Number of milliseconds since 1/1/1970 |
