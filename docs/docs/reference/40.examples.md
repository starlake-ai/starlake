# Examples

## Extract
This sample is available in the `samples/extract` directory 
First you need to set the JDBC connection to the database. Below an example on a H2 database:

```hocon
connections {
  h2-sample-db {
    format = "jdbc"
    options {
      url: "jdbc:h2:file:/my/h2db/path",
      driver: "org.h2.Driver"
    }
  }
}
```

Next create a file describing the schema you want to import. We provide below 2 examples.

### Extract All Tables: 
Extract all objects from the `PUBLIC` schema.
```yaml
jdbcSchemas:
  - connection: "h2-sample-db" # Connection name as defined in the connections section of the application.conf file
    schema: "PUBLIC" # Database schema where tables are located
    tables:
      - name: "*" # Takes all tables
    tableTypes: # One or many of the types below
      - "TABLE"
      - "VIEW"
      - "SYSTEM TABLE"
      - "GLOBAL TEMPORARY"
      - "LOCAL TEMPORARY"
      - "ALIAS"
      - "SYNONYM"
    template: "domain-template.yml" # Metadata to use for the generated YML file.

```

### Extract Specific Tables: 
Extract only the selected tables from the `PUBLIC`schema and only the selected columns from the `votes` table.
```yaml
jdbcSchemas:
  - connection: "h2-sample-db" # Connection name as defined in the connections section of the application.conf file
    schema: "PUBLIC" # Database schema where tables are located
    tables:
      - name: "speakers"
      - name: "votes"
        columns:
          - speaker_id
          - id
          - rating
    tableTypes: # One or many of the types below
      - "TABLE"
    templateFile: "domain-template.yml" # Metadata to use for the generated YML file.
```


The `templateFile` section are used to set the default values for the metadata fields in the generated `load` file. 




## Load
This section describes how to import text files (eq. json / CSV) files into your Data Factory.

### Load to Parquet
Files will be ingested and stored in parquet format in the `$COMET_DATASETS/sales/customers` and `$COMET_DATASETS/sales/orders` files.

````yaml
load:
    name: "sales"
    directory: "__COMET_TEST_ROOT__/incoming/sales"
    metadata:
      mode: "FILE"
      format: "DSV"
      withHeader: true
      quote: "\""
      escape: "\\"
      write: "APPEND"
    schemas:
      - name: "customers"
        pattern: "customers-.*.psv"
        metadata:
          separator: "|"
        attributes:
          - name: "id"
            type: "customerid"
            required: true
          - name: "signup"
            type: "datetime"
            required: false
          - name: "contact"
            type: "email"
            required: false
          - name: "birthdate"
            type: "date"
            required: false
          - name: "name1"
            type: "string"
            required: false
            rename: "firstname"
          - name: "name2"
            type: "string"
            required: false
            rename: "lastname"
      - name: "orders"
        pattern: "orders-.*.csv"
        merge:
          key:
            - "id"
          delete: "customer_id is null"
        metadata:
          separator: ","
        attributes:
          - name: "order_id"
            type: "string"
            required: true
            rename: "id"
          - name: "customer_id"
            type: "customerid"
            required: false
          - name: "amount"
            type: "decimal"
            required: false
          - name: "seller_id"
            type: "string"
            required: false
````

### Load to BigQuery
Based on the [Load to parquet](#load-to-parquet) example, the only thing we add is the /metadata/sink section
Files will be stored in the `customers` and `orders` BigQuery tables under the `sales` BigQuery dataset

````yaml
load:
    name: "sales"
    directory: "/incoming/sales"
    metadata:
      mode: "FILE"
      format: "DSV"
      withHeader: true
      quote: "\""
      escape: "\\"
      write: "APPEND"
      sink:
        type: BQ
    schemas:
      - name: "customers"
        pattern: "customers-.*.psv"
        metadata:
          separator: "|"
        attributes:
          - name: "id"
            type: "customerid"
            required: true
          - name: "signup"
            type: "datetime"
            required: false
          - name: "contact"
            type: "email"
            required: false
          - name: "birthdate"
            type: "date"
            required: false
          - name: "name1"
            type: "string"
            required: false
            rename: "firstname"
          - name: "name2"
            type: "string"
            required: false
            rename: "lastname"
      - name: "orders"
        pattern: "orders-.*.csv"
        merge:
          key:
            - "id"
          delete: "customer_id is null"
        metadata:
          separator: ","
        attributes:
          - name: "order_id"
            type: "string"
            required: true
            rename: "id"
          - name: "customer_id"
            type: "customerid"
            required: false
          - name: "amount"
            type: "decimal"
            required: false
          - name: "seller_id"
            type: "string"
            required: false
````

### Load to SQL Database

Based on the [Load to parquet](#load-to-parquet) example, we need to

1. Add  the /metadata/sink section

````yaml
load:
    name: "hr"
    directory: "/incoming/hr"
    metadata:
      mode: "FILE"
      format: "JSON"
      sink:
        type: JDBC
        connection: my_connection
        partitions: 10
        batchSize: 1000
    schemas:
      - name: "sellers"
        pattern: "sellers-.*.json"
        metadata:
          array: true
          format: "SIMPLE_JSON"
          write: "APPEND"
        attributes:
          - name: "id"
            type: "string"
            required: true
          - name: "seller_email"
            type: "email"
            required: true
          - name: "location_id"
            type: "long"
            required: true
      - name: "locations"
        pattern: "locations-.*.json"
        metadata:
          format: "JSON"
          write: "OVERWRITE"
        attributes:
          - name: "id"
            type: "string"
            required: true
          - name: "address"
            type: "struct"
            required: true
            attributes:
              - name: "city"
                type: "string"
                required: true
                metricType: "discrete"
              - name: "stores"
                type: "string"
                array: true
                required: false
              - name: "country"
                type: "string"
                required: true
                metricType: "discrete"
````

2. Add to the jdbc section a connection with the name specified in the /medata/sink/connection property

````javascript
jdbc = {
  "my_connection": {
    uri = "jdbc:postgresql://127.0.0.1:5403/mydb?user=postgres&password=XXXX-XXXX-XXXX",
    user = "postgres",
    password = "XXXX-XXXX-XXXX",
    driver = "org.postgresql.Driver"
  }
}
````

### Load to Elasticsearch
Based on the example [Load to parquet](#load-to-parquet) example, we add is the /metadata/sink section to both schemas.

For the sake of the example, we added a field to the location schema to highlight how timestamped indexes may be handled.
Indexes will be named after the domain and schema names suffixed by the timestamp if present.

The `orders` index will be named `sales_orders` and the `customers` index will have a name similar to `sales_customers-2020.01.31`

````yaml
load:
    name: "sales"
    directory: "__COMET_TEST_ROOT__/incoming/sales"
    metadata:
      mode: "FILE"
      format: "DSV"
      withHeader: true
      quote: "\""
      escape: "\\"
      write: "APPEND"
      sink:
        type: BQ
    schemas:
      - name: "customers"
        pattern: "customers-.*.psv"
        metadata:
          separator: "|"
          sink:
            type: ES
            timestamp: "{signup|yyyy.MM.dd}"
        attributes:
          - name: "id"
            type: "customerid"
            required: true
          - name: "signup"
            type: "datetime"
            required: false
          - name: "contact"
            type: "email"
            required: false
          - name: "birthdate"
            type: "date"
            required: false
          - name: "name1"
            type: "string"
            required: false
            rename: "firstname"
          - name: "name2"
            type: "string"
            required: false
            rename: "lastname"
      - name: "orders"
        pattern: "orders-.*.csv"
        merge:
          key:
            - "id"
          delete: "customer_id is null"
        metadata:
          separator: ","
          sink:
            type: ES
        attributes:
          - name: "order_id"
            type: "string"
            required: true
            rename: "id"
          - name: "customer_id"
            type: "customerid"
            required: false
          - name: "amount"
            type: "decimal"
            required: false
          - name: "seller_id"
            type: "string"
            required: false
````

#### Custom ES Template

By default, Starlake will infer from the dataset schema the properties and their types and create the ES template accordingly.
The default template template is shown below. The variable  `__ATTRIBUTES__` is substituted by the Starlake with
the ES representation of the attributes.

````json
{
  "index_patterns": ["{{domain}}.{{schema}}", "{{domain}}.{{schema}}-*"],
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": "1",
    "number_of_replicas": "0"
  },
  "mappings": {
    "_doc": {
      "_source": {
        "enabled": true
      },
      "properties": {
        {{attributes}}
      }
    }
  }
}
````

You may customize your ES template by creating a similar file with your own custom properties for a specific schema by putting it
in the file with the following name `COMET_ROOT/metadata/mapping/${domainName}/${schemaName}.json`.

You may inject the domain and schema names using the `{{domain}}` and `{{schema}}` substitution variables.


## Transform

### Parquet to Parquet

Will load the dataset `accepted/graduateProgram` under `$COMET_DATASETS` directory from the configured storage.
An absolute path may also be specified.

This example create two views : One temporary view in the `views` section, and another one in the `presql` section.
Note that the sql request in the `presql` section uses the view defined in the `views` section.

The resulting file will be stored in the `$COMET_DATASETS/business/graduateProgram/output` directory.

````yaml
---
transform:
    name: "graduateProgram"
    views:
      graduate_View: "fs:accepted/graduateProgram"
    tasks:
      - domain: "graduateProgram"
        area: "business"
        dataset: "output"
        write: "OVERWRITE"
        presql: |
          create or replace view graduate_agg_view
          select degree,
            department,
            school
          from graduate_View
          where school={{school}}
    
        sql: SELECT * FROM graduate_agg_view
````

### Transform Parquet to DSV

Based ont the [parquet to parquet](#parquet-to-parquet) example, we add the format property to request a csv output
and set coalesce to `true` to output everything in a single CSV file.

````yaml
---
transform:
    name: "graduateProgram"
    format: "csv"
    coalesce: true
    views:
      graduate_View: "fs:accepted/graduateProgram"
    tasks:
      - domain: "graduateProgram"
        area: "business"
        dataset: "output"
        write: "OVERWRITE"
        presql: |
          create or replace view graduate_agg_view
          select degree,
            department,
            school
          from graduate_View
          where school={{school}}
    
        sql: SELECT * FROM graduate_agg_view
````

### Transform Parquet to BigQuery

Based ont the [parquet to parquet](#parquet-to-parquet) example, we add the sink section to force the task to store the SQL result in BigQuery

The result will store in the current project under the `business` BigQuery dataset in the `output` table.

You may also specify the target project in the `/tasks/dataset` property using the syntax `PROJECT_ID:business`



````yaml
---
transform:
    name: "graduateProgram"
    views:
      graduate_View: "fs:accepted/graduateProgram"
    tasks:
      - domain: "graduateProgram"
        area: "business"
        dataset: "output"
        write: "OVERWRITE"
        sink:
            type: BQ
            location: EU
        presql: |
          create or replace view graduate_agg_view
          select degree,
            department,
            school
          from graduate_View
          where school={{school}}
    
        sql: SELECT * FROM graduate_agg_view
````

### BigQuery to BigQuery
We may use the Spark (SPARK) or BigQuery (BQ) engine. When using the BQ engine, no spark cluster is needed.

You may want to use the Spark engine if you need to run your jobs to stay agnostic to the underlying storage or
if you need your jobs to overwrite only the partitions present in the resulting SQL.


````yaml
---
transform:
    name: "graduateProgram"
    views:
      graduate_View: "bq:gcp_project_id:bqdataset/graduateProgram"
    tasks:
      - domain: "graduateProgram"
        sink:
            type: BQ
        area: "business"
        dataset: "output"
        write: "OVERWRITE"
        sql: SELECT * FROM graduate_View
