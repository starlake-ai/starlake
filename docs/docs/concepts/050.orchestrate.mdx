Running load and transform job is rarely a on-demand task. It is usually a scheduled job that runs periodically.

Starlake allows you to run a job on a schedule using your favorite scheduler without the need to write any code.
You simply select one or more dag templates and starlake will generate the necessary orchestration code for you.

Starlake will also analyze your SQL code for task dependencies before generating and running the tasks in the right order.
