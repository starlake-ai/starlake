# Orchestrate

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Running a load or transform job is rarely a on-demand task. It is usually a scheduled job that runs periodically.

Starlake allows you to run a job on a schedule using your favorite scheduler without the need to write any code.
You simply select one or more DAG templates and starlake will generate the necessary orchestration code for you.

The DAG you want to use may be specified at the table, domain, or project level.
You may also customize the DAG template to suit your needs.

Also, note that Starlake will also analyze your SQL code for task dependencies before generating and running the tasks in the right order.
