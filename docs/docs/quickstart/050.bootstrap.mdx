#  Bootstrap project

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Create Sample Project

To create a new project, you need first to create an empty folder and run the
starlake bootstrap CLI command from there:

<Tabs groupId="platforms">
<TabItem value="linux_macos" label="Linux/MacOS">

```
$ mkdir $HOME/quickstart
$ cd $HOME/quickstart
$ starlake bootstrap
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```
c:\> mkdir c:\quickstart
c:\> cd c:\quickstart
c:\> starlake bootstrap
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">

```
$ mkdir $HOME/quickstart
$ cd $HOME/quickstart
$ docker run  -v `pwd`:/app/quickstart -e SL_ROOT=/app/quickstart -it starlake bootstrap
```


</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::note

By default, the project will be created in the current working directory.
To bootstrap the project in a different folder set SL_ROOT env variable to that folder:


<Tabs groupId="platforms">
<TabItem value="linux_macos" label="Linux/MacOS">

```
$ SL_ROOT=/my/other/location starlake bootstrap
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```
c:\> set SL_ROOT=c:\my\other\location
c:\> starlake bootstrap
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">
You are always required to set the SL_ROOT env var when using Docker

```
$ mkdir $HOME/quickstart
$ cd $HOME/quickstart
$ docker run  -v `pwd`:/app/quickstart -e SL_ROOT=/app/quickstart -it starlake bootstrap
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::

The ```bootstrap``` command will ask you to select a project template from the list below:

``` text {3}
Please choose a template:
  0. initializer
  1. quickstart
  2. starbake
  q. quit
=> 1
```
Please choose `1. quickstart` to create a project that comes with sample datasets and be able to follow this tutorial.
starlake will then create a default project hierarchy that allow you to start extracting, loading and transforming data.


``` text {2,5,7,8,9,10}

        └── orders-2018-01-01.csv

```

## Understanding the project hierarchy

- The `incoming` folder host all the files you will want to load into your warehouse. This is explained in more detail in the [Move data section](load)
- The `metadata` folder contains the __extract__, __load__ and __transform__ configuration files
- The `sample-data` folder contains sample data that you can use to test your project
- The `expectations` folder contains the expectations configuration files used for validating the data loaded / transformed in your warehouse

## Project configuration

The project configuration is stored in the `metadata/application.sl.yml` file. This file contains the project version and the list of connections to the different data sinks.


This application configuration file contains multiple connections:
- Each connection is a sink where data can be loaded/transformed
- The active connection to use for loading/transforming data is specified in the connectionRef property of the application section
- The connectionRef property can be set to any of the connection names defined in the connections section below.
- The example below set the active connectionRef using the `connectionRef`variable

```yaml

application:
  version: "1.0.0"
  # the connection to use for loading/transforming data. See connections section below
  connectionRef: "localFilesystem"
  connections:
    localFilesystem:
      type: "fs"

```

## Next steps

That's it, we are ready to go. Let's start by [loading some data](infer-schema) into our warehouse and then [transforming it](transform) to make it ready for analysis.

:::note

In a real world, your data would be stored in a database and not in your local filesystem.

The example above is just to show you how to get started quickly.

The extract, load and transform steps are independent and you could skip any of them if you don't need to extract, load or transform data.
