Now that our file is successfully loaded and available as a table, we usually need to crate KPIs or specialized tables.
To illustrate how transform may be defined on tables, we will create two tables, one containing customers living in France
and another one containing customers living in the USA.


## Templated Job
Starlake Transforms support Jinja2 templating inside SQL requests.

We create a file `metadata/transform/bycountry.sql` with the following content

```SQL
select * from sales.customers where lower(country) like lower('{{ p_country }}')
```

The french customers will be stored in the table `cust_france` and the american customers in the table `cust_usa`.
SQL file alone is not sufficient to be a Starlake Transform.
In order to be one, a YAML file must be created next to the SQL file and have the same name.
Therefore we need to create the YAML file `metadata/jobs/bycountry.comet.yml`.
This file will instruct where the result of the SQL request will be stored.

```yaml
transform:
  name: bycountry
  tasks:
    - domain: business
      table: cust_{{ p_country }}
      write: OVERWRITE
      sink:
        type: FS

```

In this file, we instruct to read data from the dataset stored on the filesystem (location of the previously loaded data)
and store it in a view named `customers`. The key used inside `transform.views` define the name that can be used in the query.

Even if we don't connect to any database, we can note here that we are expressing the transformation of our data in SQL
by reading from a file stored on our machine.

From now on, we are ready to filter out users. Since the job is to filter on one country and store it to a dynamic destination based on the country name, we need to execute the job twice.
Once to create the french customers table and once to create the american customers.

The result will be stored on the filesystem (sink.type: FS) in the datasets/business/bycountry_usa and datasets/business/bycountry_usa
folders as parquet files.

<Tabs groupId="customers">
<TabItem value="france" label="French customers table">

```sh
$ cd $HOME/myproject
$ $HOME/starlake/starlake.sh transform --name bycountry --options p_country=France
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="usa" label="American customers table">

```sh
$ cd $HOME/myproject
$ $HOME/starlake/starlake.sh transform --name bycountry --options p_country=USA
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `--options` allow to define variables that will be used for substitution and thus allowing a query to be parameterized and even a Transform!

:::note
The `--name` will match the transform file name and not its name.

<TabItem value="redshift" label="Redshift">

Amazon Redshift uses a JDBC URL and a specific format. We need to define our redshift connection in the metadata/application.conf file as follows:

```json
connections {
  Redshift {
    format = "com.databricks.spark.redshift"
    options = {
      url: "jdbc:redshift://redshifthost:5439/database",
      user: "username",
      password: "pass",
      tempdir: "s3n://path/for/temp/data",
      aws_iam_role: "arn:aws:iam::123456789000:role/redshift_iam_role"
    }
  }
}
```

```yaml
transform:
  name: bycountry_{{ p_country }}
  engine: Redshift
  tasks:

      write: OVERWRITE
      sink:
        type: Redshift
```

<TabItem value="snowflake" label="Snowflake">

Snowflake uses a JDBC URL and a specific format. We need to define our snowflake connection in the metadata/application.conf file as follows:
