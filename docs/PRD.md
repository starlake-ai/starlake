# Starlake - Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.5.x
**Last Updated:** 2026-03-18

---

## 1. Product Overview

Starlake is a declarative data pipeline platform that enables data teams to extract, load, transform, and orchestrate their data pipelines using YAML configuration instead of code. It replaces hundreds of lines of warehouse-specific boilerplate (BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, Spark, DuckDB) with self-describing configuration files that are version-controlled, reviewed, and deployed like infrastructure-as-code.

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Data engineering teams face recurring challenges:

- **Boilerplate proliferation** - Every warehouse requires its own MERGE, UPSERT, SCD2, and COPY logic. Teams rewrite the same patterns across projects.
- **Fragile orchestration** - DAGs are hand-coded, dependencies are implicit, and pipeline changes require both SQL and orchestrator updates.
- **No governance by default** - Data quality, lineage, privacy, and access controls are bolted on after the fact, often inconsistently.
- **Warehouse lock-in** - Migrating between BigQuery, Snowflake, and Redshift means rewriting ETL code.

### 1.2 Solution

Starlake provides a single YAML-based DSL that:

1. **Abstracts warehouse differences** - One configuration, multiple target warehouses
2. **Automates write strategies** - Declare APPEND, OVERWRITE, UPSERT, SCD2, or DELETE_THEN_INSERT; Starlake generates the correct SQL
3. **Infers and enforces schemas** - Auto-detect formats, types, and separators; validate every row at load time
4. **Generates orchestration DAGs** - Extract SQL dependencies and produce Airflow/Dagster/Snowflake Task DAGs automatically
5. **Embeds governance** - Data quality expectations, column-level encryption, row-level security, and lineage are first-class configuration

### 1.3 Target Users

| Persona | Use Case |
|---|---|
| **Data Engineers** | Define and maintain ELT pipelines, manage schema evolution, configure write strategies |
| **Analytics Engineers** | Write SQL transforms, define data quality expectations, build aggregation layers |
| **Data Platform Teams** | Standardize pipeline patterns, enforce governance, manage multi-warehouse deployments |
| **Data Analysts** | Use bootstrap templates, explore lineage, run ad-hoc transforms |

      key: [order_id]
      timestamp: updated_at
  attributes:
    - name: "order_id"
      type: "long"
      required: true
    - name: "customer_id"
      type: "long"
    - name: "amount"
      type: "decimal"
      privacy: "HASH"
```

### 2.3 Transform

Execute SQL-based transformations with automatic write strategy application.

**Requirements:**
- SQL-based transform definitions with separate `.sql` and `.sl.yml` files
- Automatic MERGE INTO / INSERT OVERWRITE generation based on write strategy
- Pre-SQL and post-SQL hooks

- Interactive mode with CSV/JSON/table output
- Dry-run support (BigQuery cost estimation)
- Python UDF support
- Jinja2 templating in SQL with environment variable substitution
- Materialization options: TABLE, VIEW, ICEBERG, DELTA

**Configuration:**
```yaml
transform:
  tasks:
    - name: customer_lifetime_value
      writeStrategy:
        type: "OVERWRITE"
      schedule: "daily"
```
```sql
SELECT
  customer_id,
  SUM(amount) AS lifetime_value,
  COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
```

### 2.4 Orchestrate

Generate and deploy DAGs from declared dependencies.

**Requirements:**
- Automatic dependency inference from SQL table references
- DAG generation for Airflow (v2 and v3), Dagster, and Snowflake Tasks
- Customizable DAG templates (Jinja2)
- Schedule presets (daily, hourly, when_available, custom cron)
- DAG deployment to orchestrator filesystem or API
- Visual dependency graph output (Mermaid, GraphViz DOT, Reactflow)

### 2.5 Data Quality

Validate data at every stage of the pipeline.

**Requirements:**
- Expectations framework with Jinja2 macros (completeness, uniqueness, volume, range, etc.)
- Per-table and per-column validation rules
- Configurable failure behavior (warn vs. fail)
- Results persisted to audit database
- Row-level rejection tracking with reason codes

### 2.6 Data Governance

Embed governance into pipeline configuration.

**Requirements:**
- Column-level encryption (pluggable privacy algorithms)
- Row-level security (RLS) with role-based grants
- Access control lists (ACL) per table/column
