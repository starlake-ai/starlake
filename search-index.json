Append incoming data to existing Dynamic partition Overwrite where only the partitions to which the incoming data belong to are overwritten. Merge incoming data with existing data by keeping the newest version of each record. For performance reasons, when having huge amount of data, tables are usually split into multiple partitions. BigQuery supports range partitioning which are uncommon and date/time partitioning which is the most widely used type of partitioning. The diagram below shows our initial table partitioned by the date field. Let's assume we receive the following data that we need to ingest into the table: The strategies above will produce respectively the results below: Overwrite Append Dynamic partition Overwrite Merge The table ends up with the 2 incoming records. All existing partitions are deleted. The table ends up with 7 records. Note that a new ìtem 1 record is added while the older one is kept. The table ends up with 4 records. The second partition remains untouched while the first partition is erased and overwritten by with the incoming data. The table ends up with 4 records. Incoming and existing records are added up but only the newest version of each product in the kept in the resulting table. There is no good or bad strategy, the use of one of the strategies above depends on the use case. Some use case examples for each of the strategies are : Overwrite mode may be useful when you receive every day the list of all product names. Append mode may be useful when you receive daily sales. Dynamic Partition Overwrite mode may be useful when you ingested the first time a partition, and you need to ingest it again with a different set of data and thus alter only that partition.

The extract step allows to export selective data from an existing SQL database to a set of CSV files. The load step allows you to load text files, to ingest POSITION/CSV/JSON/XML files as strong typed records stored as parquet files or DWH tables (eq. Google BigQuery) or whatever sink you configured The transform step allows to join loaded data and save them as parquet files, DWH tables or Elasticsearch indices The Load Transform steps support multiple configurations for inputs and outputs as illustrated in the figure below. Starlake Data Pipeline steps are described below: Landing Area : In this optional step, files with predefined filename patterns are stored on a local filesystem in a predefined folder hierarchy Pending Area : Files associated with a schema are imported into this area. Accepted Area : Pending files are parsed against their schema and records are rejected or accepted and made available in Bigquery/Snowflake/Databricks/Hive/... tables or parquet files in a cloud bucket. Business Area : Tables (Hive / BigQuery / Parquet files / ...) in the working area may be joined to provide a holistic view of the data through the definition of transformations.

Starlake Data Pipeline steps are described below: Landing Area : In this optional step, files with predefined filename patterns are stored on a local filesystem in a predefined folder hierarchy Pending Area : Files associated with a schema are imported into this area. Accepted Area : Pending files are parsed against their schema and records are rejected or accepted and made available in Bigquery/Snowflake/Databricks/Hive/... tables or parquet files in a cloud bucket. Business Area : Tables (Hive / BigQuery / Parquet files / ...) in the working area may be joined to provide a holistic view of the data through the definition of transformations. Data visualization : parquet files / tables may be exposed in data warehouses or elasticsearch indices through an indexing definition Input file schemas, ingestion rules, transformation and indexing definitions used in the steps above are all defined in YAML files.","s":"How it works","u":"/starlake/docs/next/intro","h":"#how-it-works","p":786},{"i":802,"t":"CLI validate","s":"validate","u":"/starlake/docs/next/cli/validate","h":"","p":801},{"i":804,"t":"starlake validate [options]","s":"Synopsis","u":"/starlake/docs/next/cli/validate","h":"#synopsis","p":801},{"i":807,"t":"Parameter Cardinality Description --reload:<value> Optional Reload all files from disk before starting validation.

The greater the kurtosis, the less precise the standard deviation and variance become. 25th percentile: Returns the approximate 25 percentile of this attribute which is the smallest value in the ordered attribute values (sorted from least to greatest) such that no more than 25% of attribute values is less than the value or equal to that value 75 percentile: Returns the approximate 75 percentile of this attribute which is the smallest value in the ordered attribute values (sorted from least to greatest) such that no more than 75% of attribute values is less than the value or equal to that value row count When the metric property is set to discrete, Starlake will compute for this attribute the following metrics: count distinct: The number of distinct values for this attribute category frequency: The frequency (percentage) for each distinct value for this attribute category count: The number of occurrences for each distinct value for this attribute row count Each metric is computed for each attribute only on the incoming dataset and stored in a table with the ingestion time allowing to compare metric values between loads.

Divide the dataset size by the block size to get the number of partitions Save the dataset to the target location with the computed number of partitions The main drawback of this approach is that we need to save the file twice. Solution 2 : Sampling​ Get a percentage of the records in the dataframe before saving it. Save it to a temporary location Estimate the size of the final dataset on HDFS based on the size of the sample Compute the number of partitions based on this estimation Save the dataset to the target location with the computed number of partitions The Naive solution is in fact identical to the Sampling one with a sampling percentage of 100%. Solution 3 : Absolute Compaction​ The number of partitions is defined by the user at the schema level. Example : 0.0 => Means no optimisation. 1.0 => Naïve Compaction Any integer between 1 ...

Negative skew commonly indicates that the tail is on the left side of the distribution, and positive skew indicates that the tail is on the right. kurtosis: It tells us the extent to which the distribution is more or less outlier-prone (heavier or light-tailed) than the normal distribution.

The goal is to optimise the number of partitions during the write phase. You have 3 choices available : Solution 1 : Naive Compaction​ Save the file in a temporary location Get the dataset size. Divide the dataset size by the block size to get the number of partitions Save the dataset to the target location with the computed number of partitions The main drawback of this approach is that we need to save the file twice. Solution 2 : Sampling​ Get a percentage of the records in the dataframe before saving it. Save it to a temporary location Estimate the size of the final dataset on HDFS based on the size of the sample Compute the number of partitions based on this estimation Save the dataset to the target location with the computed number of partitions The Naive solution is in fact identical to the Sampling one with a sampling percentage of 100%. Solution 3 : Absolute Compaction​ The number of partitions is defined by the user at the schema level. Example : 0.0 => Means no optimisation. 1.0 => Naïve Compaction Any integer between 1 ... Int.max => Absolute number of partitions Below an example of compaction based on a sampling of 20% metadata: partition: sampling: 0.2 # compute number of partitions based on the size on disk of a sampling of 20% of the dataset attributes: - \"comet_year\" - \"comet_month\" - \"comet_day\" With the types catalog, file schemas and save strategy defined we are ready to ingest note The sampling strategy has no effect on datawarehouse that handle the compaction strategy themselves such as BigQUery, Databricks Delta or Snowflake","s":"Compaction Strategy","u":"/starlake/docs/userguide/load","h":"#compaction-strategy","p":1659},{"i":1677,"t":"The ingestion process follows the steps below : Import Step : Files are imported to the cluster in the pending area.
