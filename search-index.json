Append incoming data to existing Dynamic partition Overwrite where only the partitions to which the incoming data belong to are overwritten. Merge incoming data with existing data by keeping the newest version of each record. For performance reasons, when having huge amount of data, tables are usually split into multiple partitions. BigQuery supports range partitioning which are uncommon and date/time partitioning which is the most widely used type of partitioning. The diagram below shows our initial table partitioned by the date field. Let's assume we receive the following data that we need to ingest into the table: The strategies above will produce respectively the results below: Overwrite Append Dynamic partition Overwrite Merge The table ends up with the 2 incoming records. All existing partitions are deleted. The table ends up with 7 records. Note that a new ìtem 1 record is added while the older one is kept. The table ends up with 4 records. The second partition remains untouched while the first partition is erased and overwritten by with the incoming data. The table ends up with 4 records. Incoming and existing records are added up but only the newest version of each product in the kept in the resulting table. There is no good or bad strategy, the use of one of the strategies above depends on the use case. Some use case examples for each of the strategies are : Overwrite mode may be useful when you receive every day the list of all product names. Append mode may be useful when you receive daily sales. Dynamic Partition Overwrite mode may be useful when you ingested the first time a partition, and you need to ingest it again with a different set of data and thus alter only that partition. Merge mode may be useful when you receive product updates every day and that you need to keep only the last version of each product.","s":"Data Loading strategies","u":"/starlake/blog/spark-big-query-partitioning","h":"#data-loading-strategies","p":17},{"i":21,"t":"Apache Spark SQL connector for Google BigQuery makes BigQuery a first class citizen as a source and sink for Spark jobs.","s":"Spark How-to","u":"/starlake/blog/spark-big-query-partitioning","h":"","p":17},{"i":23,"t":"BigQuery is supported by Spark as a source and sink through the Spark BigQuery connector Spark comes out of the box with the ability to append or overwrite existing data using a predefined save mode : val incomingDF = ... // Incoming data loaded with the correct schemaval bqTable = \"project-id.dataset.table\"val saveMode = SaveMode.Overwrite // or SaveMode.Append fot he appending dataincomingDF.write .mode(saveMode) .partitionBy(\"date\") .format(\"com.google.cloud.spark.bigquery\") .option(\"table\", bqTable) .save()","s":"Append and Overwrite modes in Spark","u":"/starlake/blog/spark-big-query-partitioning","h":"#append-and-overwrite-modes-in-spark","p":17},{"i":25,"t":"To activate dynamic partitioning, you need to set the configuration below before saving the data using the exact same code above : spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.sources.partitionOverwriteMode\",\"dynamic\") Unfortunately, the BigQuery Spark connector does not support this feature (at the time of writing). We need to manually delete the partitions we want to overwrite first and then append the incoming data. Assuming the table is partitioned by the field date and the incoming data loaded in the incomingDF dataframe, the code below will remove existing partitions that need to be overwritten. Delete partitions that need to be updated val incomingDF = ... // Incoming data loaded with the correct schemaincomingDF .select(date_format(col(\"date\"), \"yyyyMMdd\").cast(\"string\")) .distinct() .collect() .map(_.getString(0)) .foreach { partition => bigQueryClient.deleteTable(TableId.of(datasetName, s\"$table\\$$partition\")); } tip To drop a table partition using the Google Cloud bq command line tool, you may use the following syntax: bq rm -t 'project-id.dataset.table$YYYYMMDD' We now need to append the incomingDF to mimic the dynamic partition overwrite feature: Append incoming partitions val incomingDF = ... // Incoming data loaded with the correct schemaval bqTable = \"project-id.dataset.table\"val saveMode = SaveMode.AppendincomingDF.write .mode(saveMode) .partitionBy(\"date\") .format(\"com.google.cloud.spark.bigquery\") .option(\"table\", bqTable) .save() caution The issue with this approach is that if the program crashes during the \"appending\" of the incoming data, partitions will have been deleted and data would be lost.

The figure above describes how Starlake implements the Extract Load Transform (ELT) Data Pipeline steps. Starlake may be used indistinctly for all or any of these steps. The extract step allows to export selective data from an existing SQL database to a set of CSV files. The load step allows you to load text files, to ingest POSITION/CSV/JSON/XML files as strong typed records stored as parquet files or DWH tables (eq. Google BigQuery) or whatever sink you configured The transform step allows to join loaded data and save them as parquet files, DWH tables or Elasticsearch indices The Load Transform steps support multiple configurations for inputs and outputs as illustrated in the figure below. Starlake Data Pipeline steps are described below: Landing Area : In this optional step, files with predefined filename patterns are stored on a local filesystem in a predefined folder hierarchy Pending Area : Files associated with a schema are imported into this area. Accepted Area : Pending files are parsed against their schema and records are rejected or accepted and made available in Bigquery/Snowflake/Databricks/Hive/... tables or parquet files in a cloud bucket. Business Area : Tables (Hive / BigQuery / Parquet files / ...) in the working area may be joined to provide a holistic view of the data through the definition of transformations. Data visualization : parquet files / tables may be exposed in data warehouses or elasticsearch indices through an indexing definition Input file schemas, ingestion rules, transformation and indexing definitions used in the steps above are all defined in YAML files.","s":"How it works","u":"/starlake/docs/0.8.0/intro","h":"#how-it-works","p":203},{"i":219,"t":"CLI yml2gv","s":"yml2gv","u":"/starlake/docs/0.8.0/cli/yml2gv","h":"","p":218},{"i":221,"t":"starlake yml2gv [options]","s":"Synopsis","u":"/starlake/docs/0.8.0/cli/yml2gv","h":"#synopsis","p":218},{"i":223,"t":"Generate GraphViz files from Domain / Schema YAML files","s":"Description","u":"/starlake/docs/0.8.0/cli/yml2gv","h":"#description","p":218},{"i":225,"t":"Parameter Cardinality Description --output-dir:<value> Optional Where to save the generated dot file ?

When the metric property is set to continuous, Starlake will compute for this attribute the following metrics: minimum value maximum value sum of all values mean: The arithmetic average median: the value separating the higher half from the lower half, may be thought of as \"the middle\" value variance: How far the values are spread out from their average value. standard deviation: square root of the variance, the standard deviation measures how spread out numbers are in a data set missing values skewness: The measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution. Negative skew commonly indicates that the tail is on the left side of the distribution, and positive skew indicates that the tail is on the right. kurtosis: It tells us the extent to which the distribution is more or less outlier-prone (heavier or light-tailed) than the normal distribution. The greater the kurtosis, the less precise the standard deviation and variance become. 25th percentile: Returns the approximate 25 percentile of this attribute which is the smallest value in the ordered attribute values (sorted from least to greatest) such that no more than 25% of attribute values is less than the value or equal to that value 75 percentile: Returns the approximate 75 percentile of this attribute which is the smallest value in the ordered attribute values (sorted from least to greatest) such that no more than 75% of attribute values is less than the value or equal to that value row count When the metric property is set to discrete, Starlake will compute for this attribute the following metrics: count distinct: The number of distinct values for this attribute category frequency: The frequency (percentage) for each distinct value for this attribute category count: The number of occurrences for each distinct value for this attribute row count Each metric is computed for each attribute only on the incoming dataset and stored in a table with the ingestion time allowing to compare metric values between loads.

A load job is a job that load files from disk, validate the input records and store them in the target datawarehouse metadata/transform: this directory contains all the information related to transform jobs. A transform job is a job that run against existing tables on the target database and write the result in a target table. These are usually jobs that compute KPIs by aggregating values from different fact tables and or apply specific transformations to do some cleaning. metadata/types: this is a companion directory to the metadata/load directory. It contains all the custom types validation you wish to apply on the records loaded from a file. We may require a record column to have a specific length or to verify a specific pattern like an email for example. This allows to go much further than simply checking the input against standard python or java types. metadata/expectations: This directory contains a library of expectations we may want to use in our project. Expectations are used to validate the data we load into our datawarehouse. For example, we may want to check that the number of records loaded in a table is greater than 0. metadata/connections.sl.yml: This file contains all the connections to our datawarehouse, although usually we just have one connection. metadata/refs.sl.yml: In your SQL transforms, we may be joining tables coming from different domains or databases. In that case, we normally need to reference our tables by their full names such as: project-id.domain.my-table. The refs file allows us to make our query more readable by allowing to map the name my-table to its full name. metadata/env.[SL_ENV].sl.yml: we may use any of the variables defined in the env files in your extract, load and transforms jobs.

The extract step allows to export selective data from an existing SQL database to a set of CSV files. The load step allows you to load text files, to ingest POSITION/CSV/JSON/XML files as strong typed records stored as parquet files or DWH tables (eq.

Divide the dataset size by the block size to get the number of partitions Save the dataset to the target location with the computed number of partitions The main drawback of this approach is that we need to save the file twice.

A load job is a job that load files from disk, validate the input records and store them in the target datawarehouse metadata/transform: this directory contains all the information related to transform jobs. A transform job is a job that run against existing tables on the target database and write the result in a target table. These are usually jobs that compute KPIs by aggregating values from different fact tables and or apply specific transformations to do some cleaning. metadata/types: this is a companion directory to the metadata/load directory. It contains all the custom types validation you wish to apply on the records loaded from a file. We may require a record column to have a specific length or to verify a specific pattern like an email for example. This allows to go much further than simply checking the input against standard python or java types. metadata/expectations: This directory contains a library of expectations we may want to use in our project.

Negative skew commonly indicates that the tail is on the left side of the distribution, and positive skew indicates that the tail is on the right. kurtosis: It tells us the extent to which the distribution is more or less outlier-prone (heavier or light-tailed) than the normal distribution. The greater the kurtosis, the less precise the standard deviation and variance become. 25th percentile: Returns the approximate 25 percentile of this attribute which is the smallest value in the ordered attribute values (sorted from least to greatest) such that no more than 25% of attribute values is less than the value or equal to that value 75 percentile: Returns the approximate 75 percentile of this attribute which is the smallest value in the ordered attribute values (sorted from least to greatest) such that no more than 75% of attribute values is less than the value or equal to that value row count When the metric property is set to discrete, Starlake will compute for this attribute the following metrics: count distinct: The number of distinct values for this attribute category frequency: The frequency (percentage) for each distinct value for this attribute category count: The number of occurrences for each distinct value for this attribute row count Each metric is computed for each attribute only on the incoming dataset and stored in a table with the ingestion time allowing to compare metric values between loads.

These default types are located in the file $SL_ROOT/metadata/types/default.sl.yml and they may be redefined in the file $SL_ROOT/metadata/types/types.sl.yml File $SL_ROOT/metadata/types/default.sl.yml types: - name: \"string\" primitiveType: \"string\" pattern: \".+\" sample: \"Hello World\" comment: \"Any set of chars\" - name: \"byte\" primitiveType: \"byte\" pattern: \".\" sample: \"x\" comment: \"Any set of chars\" - name: \"date\" primitiveType: \"date\" pattern: \"yyyy/MM/dd\" sample: \"2018/07/21\" comment: \"Data in the format yyyy/MM/dd\" - name: \"double\" primitiveType: \"double\" pattern: \"-?\\\\d*\\\\.{0,1}\\\\d+\" sample: \"-45.78\" comment: \"Any floating value\" - name: \"long\" primitiveType: \"long\" pattern: \"-?\\\\d+\" sample: \"-64564\" comment: \"any positive or negative number\" - name: \"boolean\" primitiveType: \"boolean\" pattern: \"(?i)true|yes|[y1]<-TF->(?i)false|no|[n0]\" sample: \"TruE\" - name: \"timestamp\" primitiveType: \"timestamp\" pattern: \"epoch_milli\" sample: \"1548165436433\" comment: \"date/time in epoch millis\" Any semantic type that maps to the boolean primitive type must match against a special regex. This regex is made of two parts separated by the string \"<-TF->\". values matching the left side will be interpreted as the boolean value \"true\" and values matching the right side will be interpreted as the boolean value \"false\". We may add new types that map to these primitive types. For our example above, we will add the following semantic types to allow better validation on the input fields $SL_ROOT/metadata/types/types.sl.yml types: - name: \"email\" primitiveType: \"string\" pattern: \"[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\\\\\\\.[A-Za-z]{2,6}\" sample: \"me@company.com\" comment: \"Valid email only\" - name: \"customerid\" primitiveType: \"string\" pattern: \"[A-Z][0-9]{6}\" sample: \"A123456\" comment: \"Letter followed by 6 digits\" - name: \"sellerid\" primitiveType: \"string\" pattern: \"[0-9]{6}\" sample: \"123456\" comment: \"6 digits string\" Now that we have defined the set of semantic types we want to recognize, we may start defining our schemas.","s":"Type Rules","u":"/starlake/docs/userguide/load","h":"#type-rules","p":1557},{"i":1564,"t":"Files are organized by domain. In our example, the \"customers\" and \"orders\" files belong to the \"sales\" domain and the \"sellers\" file belong to the \"HR\" domain. Domain rules are YAML files located in the folder $SL_ROOT/metadata/load. They defined : The directory where the files coming from this domain are stored The ack extension for ack files. \"ack\" by default. Raw file extensions to recognize. \"json\", \"csv\", \"dsv\", \"psv\" by default. The load pipeline also automatically recognize compressed files with the extension \"tgz\", \"gz\" and \"zip\". These files are uncompressed in a temporary location and each raw file in the archive is ingested if the filename matches a file pattern in one of the schema in the domain, otherwise the file is moved to the \"unsolved\" folder under the domain name in the cluster. The file below explains it all: File $SL_ROOT/metadata/load/sales/_config.sl.yml load: name: \"sales\" # optional, derived from the directory name directory: \"/mnt/incoming/sales\" ack: \"ack\" This instruct the Starlake Data Pipeline to scan the \"/mnt/incoming/sales\" directory note To process files without relying on ack files, simply omit or define the ack attribute with an empty string :ack : \"\" To ingest files present in the domain incoming directory (/mnt/incoming/sales), we need to add schema definitions to the domain description file, aka $SL_ROOT/metadata/load/_config.yml.

The goal is to optimise the number of partitions during the write phase. You have 3 choices available : Solution 1 : Naive Compaction​ Save the file in a temporary location Get the dataset size. Divide the dataset size by the block size to get the number of partitions Save the dataset to the target location with the computed number of partitions The main drawback of this approach is that we need to save the file twice. Solution 2 : Sampling​ Get a percentage of the records in the dataframe before saving it. Save it to a temporary location Estimate the size of the final dataset on HDFS based on the size of the sample Compute the number of partitions based on this estimation Save the dataset to the target location with the computed number of partitions The Naive solution is in fact identical to the Sampling one with a sampling percentage of 100%. Solution 3 : Absolute Compaction​ The number of partitions is defined by the user at the schema level. Example : 0.0 => Means no optimisation. 1.0 => Naïve Compaction Any integer between 1 ...
