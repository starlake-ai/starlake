/** HDFS does not have a file locking mechanism. We implement it here in the following way
  *   - A file is locked when it's modification time is less than 5000ms than the current time
  *   - If the modification time is older tahn the current time of more than 5000ms, it is
  *     considered unlocked.
  *   - The owner of a lock spawn a thread that update the modification every 5s to keep the lock
  *   - The process willing to get the lock check every 5s second for the modification time of the
  *     file to gain the lock.
  *   - When a process gain the lock, it deletes the file first and tries to create a new one, this
  *     make sure that of two process gaining the lock, only one will be able to recreate it after
  *     deletion.
  *
  * To gain the lock, call [[tryLock]], to release it, call `release()`. If you are going to use the
  * lock and release it within the same call stack frame, please consider calling `tryExclusively()`
  * (as in exclusive(delay) { action }`) instead.
  *
